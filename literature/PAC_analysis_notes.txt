PAC analysis notes

PAC values are based on two aspects of the modulator and modulated signals: the intensity of the modulation and the consistency of phase between the  modulator and modulated signals. Additionally, more information is obtained by recording the phase difference between the signals, as there may be stability at different phase differences in a relatively long period of observation, as observed in the presentation.

These two aspects should be modeled as dimensionless quantities over some interval, presumably some multiple or fraction of the wavelength of modulator signal, depending on the statistical aspects, i.e. the minimum number of points needed for a meaningful estimate, which I would take as about 30, and having a large enough fraction of the modulator signal. For theta-beta coupling this would be about 1/2 a theta wavelength and about 2 beta wavelengths for data sampled at 256 samples per second. I can't see working with less than 1/2 the wavelength of the modulator signal. Note that actual values of the signals are also of importance in understanding the process which is the subject of the analysis, but it is important to have clarity about the difference between dimensional and dimensionless quantities.

The appropriate measure for intensity is the coefficient of variation (standard deviation / mean). Given that the amplitude of the modulated signal is always positive and is approximately sinusoidal, we note that a complete sinusoid has a standard deviation of about .7, which implies that this is the upper bound for the coefficient of variation of an always positive sinusoid. If we relax the sinusoidal constraint, we can create an always positive periodic signal with mean 1 and standard deviation 1, but the combined constraints of positivity and approximate periodicity, i.e. low skewness, limit the coefficient of variation to be close to 1.

In order to attribute phase to the modulated amplitude signal, which is not provided in the initial stage of the analysis, successive ascending and descending intervals of values (X(t)) can be linearly mapped to the intervals [-\pi, 0] and [0, \pi] respectively. (Note these are the phases of a cosine curve from -\pi to \pi.)

There is no necessity to attribute amplitude at specific points for the PAC calculation, but it can be found for a given interval of values X(t_1, ... t_n) as 1/2 the distance between the minimum and maximum values of the interval. On the other hand, given that the values of the interval are X(t_i) = amplitude(t_i) * cosine(\theta(t_i)), so that amplitude(t_i) could be set to the minimum of 1/2 the distance between the extrema of X(t_1, ... t_n) and X(t_i)/cosine(\theta(t_i)). This is to prevent small values of cosine(\theta(t_i)) affecting the amplitude when \theta(t_i) is near \pi/2 or -\pi/2 where cosine(\theta(t_i)) is near 0.

Given the above considerations and assuming the use of wavelet transform using the complex Morlet wavelet to create the bandpass filtered signals, which directly provides the phase values for the modulator signal, the phases of the modulator signal and the modulated amplitude signal could be compared by calculating the phase synchrony of the differences in phase between the modulating signal x_i and the amplitude modulated signal y_i as given by complex representation for index i:
	z_i = (x_i/|x_i|) * conj(y_i/|y_i|);
for each of the points on an sufficiently long section and then form 
	Z = sum(z_i)/sum(abs(z_i)).
Then abs(Z) is the phase_synchrony of the two signals and angle(Z) is the mean angle between them. It is better to plot the cosine of the angle than the angle itself in order to eliminate the disconcerting discontinuities which occur when the angle crosses from \pi to -\pi (or 0 to 2\pi), and more importantly to make the extrema of the curve correspond to the phase differences of 0 and \pi.

Although the coefficient of variation is not plotted in the presentation figures, eyeballing the pages and noting that most of the minima of the modulated amplitude curves are close to 0, it is safe to conclude that the coefficients of variation are close to the maximal. Only when the minima are significantly larger than 0, such as shown on page 2 in the plot of the Incongruent case for FZ (blue line) between 1 and 1.5 seconds is the calculation needed. The calculation must span an interval from one extremum to the next or between corresponding points from one wavelength to another.

Open questions:
1) Given that the representations on pages 6 and 7 of the presentation PDF, particularly the green and blue curves, cover the phenomena of interest, what values should be collected for subsequent statistical analysis?
If PAC were to be calculated for individual trials, which would use exactly the same procedure, we would have statistical characteristics of the values calculated for the mean. The expectation would be that for the individuals trials the distribution of the phase synchrony values (blue lines in pages 6 & 7) over the 2.25 seconds would have lower values and steeper ascents and descents than for the mean. My expectation is partly from my recollection of looking at a fair number of individual trials a number of years ago. The individual trials looked similar to each other, which some degree of temporal shifting among the different trials.

2) Dealing with various heterogeneities in PAC
a) For a given modulated wavelength, between electrode variation in modulating frequency.
b) For given modulated wavelength, asymmetries in modulation pattern, apparent in the page 2 plot of the congruent case, in which the modulation has prolonged high value segments and shortened low value segments int interval between 750 ms and 1250 ms. This could be estimated by the phase synchrony of the difference between succesive phases over different intervals.
